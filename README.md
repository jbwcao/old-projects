A collection of some of my previous projects, mostly from my high school days\
Each folder constitutes a seperate project

In alphabetical order:\
**Arduino Piano**\
An Arduino Sketch that I used in the creation of a piano that played tones via button presses corresponding to the digital pins on an Arduino\
Octave changes via pins 0 and 12 (down and up an octave, respectively)\
Pins 2 through 9 inclusive and descending correspond to the notes of a C major scale\
Pin 11 adds a half step to the note being played (this allows for sharps and flats)\
Pin 13 plays a tone constantly

**Hunger Games Simulator**\
A program that takes the names of tributes you give it and simulates a Hunger Games modeled after Suzanne Collins' book "The Hunger Games"\
The folder contains both a Python and C# version

**Image Compression**\
An image compression algorithm that uses low-rank approximation to compress images lossily

**Perfect Circle**\
An automatic tool for drawing perfect circles on 1920 x 1080 displays.\
In particular, I made this to draw a perfect circle on the neal.fun draw a perfect circle website. This program achieves 99.9%, (I believe 100% may be impossible because of rounding).

**Word Game Solver**\
Takes a set of characters and returns words of varying lengths that can be made from unscrabling those chracters\
Is slow for longer words
